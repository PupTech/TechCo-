<p> OK so I am learning how to code a website. This is pretty new to me but I've done something like this before and this is really fun, I would also like to learn how to code a game so that I am familiar with coding languages. You need to learn how to code if you want to make a game, computer, or anything that is going to be on a computer or is portable, like an Iphone. People who want to become inventors or scientists we need them if we want a better future and a better life. </p>
